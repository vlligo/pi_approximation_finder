# Pi approximation finder
Getting best common fraction approximation to the pi number
## Basic usage
Compile and run `main.cpp`. You may do it by the following commands in terminal:\n
```
$ g++ main.cpp -o main
$ ./main
```
Then you will need to enter a positive integer number and the programm will colculate:
- Best common fraction approximation with numerator and denominator equal or less than the entered number
- First 15 digits of this fraction
- Difference between the fraction and the pi number(first 15 decimal digits)
